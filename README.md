# instagram-scraper
A simple Instagram webscraper. Utilizes Bibliogram, an Instagram frontend that takes data from public posts and makes it downloadable. The primary purpose of Bibliogram, however, is to allow easy viewing and browsing of Instagram without needing an account. The Bibliogram project has been discontinued, so this scraper may not work as intended. See https://bibliogram.art/ for more information. See also https://bibliogram.org/, which is the Bibliogram instance currently used by this scraper (and perhaps the only one to exist, currently). This scraper works as of 12/23/2022 for images and videos in a standard Instagram post. However, see the comments in instagram_ripper.py for more information about using this program.
