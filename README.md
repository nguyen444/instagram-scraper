# instagram-scraper
A simple Instagram webscraper. Utilizes Bibliogram, an Instagram frontend that takes data from public posts and makes it downloadable. The primary purpose of Bibliogram, however, is to allow easy viewing and browsing of Instagram without needing an account. The Bibliogram project has been discontinued, so this scraper may not work as intended. See https://bibliogram.art/ for more information.
